### Skyserver
SkyServer's tools allow you to access all publicly available data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, one of the largest surveys of the night sky ever made. You can use SDSS data to learn about the way the universe works, or even to do original scientific research!

    http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/tools/started/startedhome.aspx

You can directly submit a SQL (Structured Query Language) query to the SDSS database server.

And even queries for large datasets

Some nice open clusters that have photometry in DR7. Note, that later releases don't have photometry for crowded fields.

If stars are too bright, photometry becomes a problem so choose clusters where PSFs don't blend.

    M67
    NGC 2420
    NGC 6791

Look up clusters using the SDSS navigate tool or other sky viewer tool
